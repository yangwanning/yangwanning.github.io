intro: |
  The project amis at using question retrieval techniques to faciliate Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms. Traditionally, users need to wait for their answers from other online users and the waiting time could be very long. Assuming that if we can use retrieval technique to find some historical questions that similar to users' questions, the system just need to return those historical questions' answers to users directly. This approach can greatly increase the user experience.



  The work was done under the supervision of Professor [Claudia Hauff](//https://chauff.github.io/) in [Web Information Systems group](//https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/) of TU Delft.
